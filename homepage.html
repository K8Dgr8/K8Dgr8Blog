	<h1>Hello World!</h1>

	<h2>My first post on my first coding blog</h2>

	<div class="FirstParagraph">
		<p>Hi, my name is kate, and this is my first ever coding post, on my first coding blog.</p>

		<p>I am so excited! And I know it does not look like much yet, I am in the process of learning after all!</p>
		</div>

	<p>Hopefuly with time, this will start looking more and more professional, my writing will improve, and the content will get better.</p>

	<p>I started learning coding in the past month, but only in the past week got more serious about it, the passion just came from nowhere.. I only now got to the <strong>Javascript</strong> part, and I don't feel like I master <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> yet, but the whole point of having this blog is having something to work on.</p>

	<p>This morning I read a great <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-go-from-hobbyist-to-professional-developer-11a8b8a52b5f" target="_blank">article</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/@kenrogers" target="_blank">Ken Rogers</a>, that was talking about how to move from coding as a hobby to becoming a real developer*, and one of the tips was to set up an online presence. It's kind of the opposite of what I feel comfortable with, but I have also recently learned, that in order to succeed, you MUST step out of your comfort zone, so here I am, applying two things that I learned today (the first being online presence, the other to tell about what you learned) while bravely stepping out of my comfort zone.</p>

	<p>So far, this Saturday morning feels really accomplished!</p>

	<p class="note">*The dream!</p>
